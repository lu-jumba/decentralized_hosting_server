Blockchain-Based Decentralized Hosting Server in Rust

Project Overview
This project is a blockchain-based decentralized hosting server built with Substrate in Rust, featuring decentralized application (dApp) hosting, role-based access control, staking and validator management, and cross-chain compatibility. 
It integrates with IPFS for decentralized storage and provides a React-based dashboard for users to upload, manage, and interact with decentralized applications.

Key Features

Substrate-Based Blockchain: 
A modular and extensible blockchain framework built using Substrate.
dApp Hosting: Users can upload decentralized applications (dApps) that are stored on IPFS and approved by network admins before being made available for download.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 
Admin, Validator, and User roles define the permissions and actions that network participants can perform.

Staking Mechanism: 
Users can become validators by staking tokens, participating in block validation, and earning rewards.
Cross-Chain Compatibility: Users can send messages and tokens between different blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

React Dashboard: 
A user-friendly frontend to interact with the blockchain, manage nodes, upload/download dApps, and handle cross-chain transfers.

IPFS Integration: 
Decentralized storage for hosting and downloading dApps.

Project Structure
The project is divided into two main components:

Substrate Node (Blockchain Backend): 
Built using Rust and Substrate, this includes all the necessary pallets for handling the core blockchain logic, dApp management, and cross-chain communication.

React Dashboard (Frontend): 
A React-based frontend that interacts with the blockchain, allowing users to manage their dApps, monitor node health, and handle cross-chain transactions.

Directory Structure

Prerequisites

Rust (for Substrate development)

Node.js (for React dashboard)

IPFS (for decentralized storage)

1. Substrate Node Setup

Install Rust and Substrate dependencies:

bash

curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

rustup default stable

rustup update nightly

rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly

Clone the repository and build the Substrate node:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-hosting-server.git

cd blockchain-hosting-server/substrate-node/

cargo build --release

Run the Substrate node:

bash

./target/release/node-template --dev --tmp

2. IPFS Setup

Install IPFS:

bash

wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.12.2/go-ipfs_v0.12.2_linux-amd64.tar.gz

tar -xvzf go-ipfs_v0.12.2_linux-amd64.tar.gz

cd go-ipfs

sudo bash install.sh

Start the IPFS daemon:

bash

ipfs init

ipfs daemon

3. React Dashboard Setup

Install Node.js dependencies:

bash

cd blockchain-hosting-server/react-dashboard/

npm install

Run the React dashboard:

bash

npm start

Key Functionalities

1. dApp Upload and Approval Process
   
Users upload dApps using the dashboard. Each dApp is stored on IPFS and submitted for approval by network admins.

2. Admins review and approve or reject the dApp.
   
Approved dApps become available for download via the dashboard.

3. Staking and Validator Management

Users can stake tokens to become validators and participate in the consensus mechanism (e.g., block validation).
Validators are rewarded for producing valid blocks.

4. Cross-Chain Message Transfers

Users can send messages and tokens to other blockchains (e.g., Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain) using the Cross-Chain Bridge.
Cross-chain messages are routed through the pallet and recorded on the chain.

Testing

Comprehensive tests for the Substrate runtime and React components, as well as integration tests for the full workflow.

1. Running Substrate Tests

From the substrate-node directory:

bash

cargo test

2. Running React Tests

From the react-dashboard directory:

bash

npm test

3. Running Integration Tests

From the substrate-node directory:

bash

cargo test --test integration_tests

Deployment

Deploying the Substrate Node

After testing, deploy the Substrate node using your preferred cloud provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.). The node should be launched with public RPC and WebSocket endpoints.

Deploying the React Dashboard

Build the React application:

bash

npm run build

Deploy the build/ folder to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3.
